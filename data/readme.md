# Teton Idaho

The data files in the data directory are from the County of Teton Idaho.  The data is in the public domain as per [the OpenStreetMap US Talk mailing list](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-us/2016-August/016610.html)


Hey all, and mappers in Idaho in particular!

I spoke with the GIS person of Teton County in Idaho. This is a popular
area with tourists (Grand Teton NP, Jackson Hole, ECLIPSE 2017!!) and he
received an increasing number of complaints from folks getting lost using
apps / sites based on OSM data. He offered locally produced, surveyed
(craft!) data so we may improve OSM. I uploaded it here[1], who wants to
take a stab at thinking about ways to incorporate improvements into OSM?

I did confirm with him that this data resides in the **PD** but I can get a
written note to that effect if you want.

I am also happy to put you in touch with him if you want.
